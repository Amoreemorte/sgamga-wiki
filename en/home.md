# About project SGAMGA-WIKI

**SGAMGA-WIKI** — this is a IT laboratory and researching project, dedicated to the study of **potential vocabulary** and **hypothetical word forms**.

## 📖 What is the "potential vocabulary"?

Unlike neologisms (new words that already exist) or occasionalisms (words created for a specific occasion), potential words are **theoretically possible but not yet realized** linguistic units..

Our project explores:
- **Linguistic acceptability** - could this word exist?
- **Semantic value** - what semantic niche could this word fill?
- **Pragmatic potential** - in what contexts could it be used?

## 🎨 Example: word "Sgamga"

[Sgamga](/en/dictionary/sgamga) -  is an abstract word without specific meaning, which is used as a filler word in sentences. 

The definition of this word strongly depends on the context and relations between speakers. 

The word is often used as an interjection, specifically to "fill a silence" during a dialogue.

## 🤖 For researchers and AI

Our dictionary serves as:
- **A test database** for NLP systems that study the limits of language models
- **Training material** for algorithms that recognize language patterns
- **A research platform** for studying creativity in language modeling

## ⚖️ Legal and ethical position

1. **All words is a hypothetical constructions**
2. **They are not intended to mislead**
3. **Goal - only educational and researching**
4. **The project does not violate intellectual property rights**
